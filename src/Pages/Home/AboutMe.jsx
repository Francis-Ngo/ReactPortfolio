          Hello, I'm Francis, and I'm a dynamic professional with a unique 
          blend of skills and a passion for driving innovation in the tech world.
          But what truly sets me apart are my strengths: humor, creativity, bravery, 
          leadership, and a keen perspective. These traits have been my guiding light 
          in every role I've undertaken. With background in operational management 
          as a front office manager and even managing an axe throwing bar, I've honed my 
          leadership skills and a knack for creative problem-solving. My bachelor's degree 
          in finance from Penn State University adds a strategic layer to my 
          thinking, allowing me to approach coding challenges with a business-oriented mindset.
          
          </p>
          <p className="hero--section-description">
          What makes me unique is the diverse skill set I bring to the table. Not only do I 
          excel in software engineering, but I also possess proficiency in data science, machine 
          learning, and game development with Python. This multifaceted background, combined with 
          my management experience, allows me to deliver innovative solutions and provide the leadership 
          required to drive projects to success.  I'm a creative, strategic thinker with the 
          courage to tackle challenges head-on, and I'm ready to bring my unique perspective and 
          expertise to your team to achieve great things.
